This application was developed as part of the [Connex Telecommunica.ons Angular / Java Project](TakeHome_Assignment_FullStack.pdf) challenge.

It is a Spring Boot Reactive Webflux application that also serves static resources.
The deployment target is the traditional approach, such as [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

The application leverages the [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database?tck=docs_server) cloud NoSQL database for data storage.

The computation of a premium involves a set of configurations initialized by Spring Boot in a NavigableMap.
This design allows us to modify rules without redeploying the application, thanks to the integration with a config server.
